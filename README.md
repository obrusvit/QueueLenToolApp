# QueueLenToolApp

This was fun...
In my Master's thesis, I dealt with [Emergency Vehicle Preemption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signal_preemption). The proposed algorithm utilized the information about the current queue size (number of vehicles standing at stopline), but a system or a detector which would give us this info was not available for the intersection at the time.

This android app helped us in the experiment in real traffic. A person (thank you Loi and Vojta) stood at the side of the intersection, counted the vehicles periodically, entered the number to the app and sent it directly to the traffic lights controller. A program was ready in the traffic lights controller to interpret the message (thank you Ivo).
